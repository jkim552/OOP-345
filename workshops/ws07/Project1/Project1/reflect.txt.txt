Q1>>
I used vector and algorithm standard template library functions to perform this workshop.
Since, the SongCollection was a vector of songs, I used auto keyword to access its content
and not use manual loop instead.
For example, 
for (auto& _song : collection) 
will iterate through all the content in the collection and implemented the result that I
was looking for.

Q2>>
Using STL algorithms are faster and clearer in a way because I can do anything with it 
rather than creating a temporary statement to manually iterate throughout its content.
Implementing the funtionality myself can be used in a more specific situation where I 
know the amount of the length I need to access through.
I was able to understand its concept of STL algorithms through this workshop which was
easier than I was designing through my head.

Q3>>
If the client specifies an invalid field, I would implement a function where if the given 
parameter is not what I was looking for. ( title, album, and length) , then throw an exception
that invalid parameter was given, and ask the user to prompt for different input.
