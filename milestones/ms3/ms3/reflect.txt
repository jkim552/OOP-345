The first two milestones were pretty easy for me to finish. However, the last milestone
took me a while to debug to find correct output. It was my first time using deque and 
vector type which I had to go over the notes and research more on cplusplusreference
to find built-in functions to use. 

Also, for function displayStationsSorted(), took me the most time to implement but the 
outcome was pretty simple. I just had to create another private variable called Sorted
which stores the stations on the assembly line in the order they are linked.
I was able to store that during the constructor which was very simple for me to display
afterwards.

This milestone gave me insights on how vectors and deque are used and was able to
understand further during the debugging process.
Thank you for your instructions!
